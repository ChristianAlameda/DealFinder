Deal Finder
We all have wishlist items that we have our eyes on. When it comes to high-value purchases, it can often be a challenge to find the best deal available to us when purchasing what we want.

A web application with built-in mobile notifications to let us know when the product or service we want is available and at a competitive price is a valuable and interesting intermediate-level coding project.

A good example is a web scraper that interrogates the product page in question and then notifies us when itâ€™s on sale or has been re-stocked.
